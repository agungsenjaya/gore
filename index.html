              <p class="text-justify">In a universe where Godzillas are still alive there's this particular Godzilla that most of the creatures are afraid of.
                He lives alone on a heel near by the Olympus mountain. Nobody really understand why he becomes such an angry Godzilla. Once in a while,every other creatures will hear his gruesome roar, and decided to hide. Days after days, his roar is getting louder, sometimes the other creatures even see him pull out the trees around him and throw it away.
                "His temperament is getting worse!", one of the creature speak up.
                "If we keep letting him do this, he will destroy our village and put us in danger".
                Every other creatures are looking down, try to think of an escape.
                Some of them suggest that they should leave the village and build another live out there, the other suggest to trap the Godzilla and kill him, before he kill them.
                After long talk of discussion and debate, one of the oldest creature finally stand and speak up.
                "Let's visit him, and hear him out. Who knows, he actually need our help" The old man said.
                "Are you losing your mind!?" Shout one of the creature.
                "Are you trying to get us all killed!?" They said in trembling voice."Instead of guessing and put us all in a harder situation, let's just ask him. I don't think he is as bad as we thought" Continue the old man.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p class="text-justify">
                After a long pause and humming all over the place, all of them are agree to follow the old man advise.
                On the next day, 10 creatures including the old man, are preparing their journey to the angry Godzilla's place. After 3 hours of hiking, they saw a sleeping Godzilla, his face look so pale and his forehead is frowning. The 10 creatures are looking to each other, some of them are terrified.
                The old man walk carefully towards the Godzilla, and now he stand before the Godzilla's face. He touched the Godzilla's skin, it is cold and sweaty, the old man thought that the Godzilla must be in pain.
                He tries to wake him up.
                "Hello mister Godzilla, can you hear my voice?" Said the old man softly.
                Godzilla's face moving, and he open his eyes slowly, surprised by the old man's emergence, he wakes in sudden, backed up and scream loudly.
                "Rrrrrooooooooaaaaaarrrrrrrrrr!!!"
                He screamed.
                The old man is pushed back up, and he almost fly away.
                Feeling tired, the Godzilla stop screaming and back up even further, seems like he's losing his breath.
                After everything is calmed down, the old man walk closer towards the Godzilla, and speak softly, "Hello mister Godzilla, we have been hearing you roaring for a long time. Sometimes, you throw things away and almost crush our village. If I may know, what is happening to you? Are you okay?"</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <p class="text-justify">
                The Godzilla, with his red bloody eyes looks confused and hesitated for a second, but finally opened his mouth and say, "Oh old man, thank you for asking. I have been in pain for so long. I wake up with nothing but hunger! I am furious and confused. Nothing can really satisfied my hunger. I don't think anyone could help me" Said the Godzilla silently.
"Oh poor mister Godzilla, let me get back to my friends and see if we can help you" Said the old man.
The Godzilla nods his head.
The old man walk towards his friends, the other 9 creatures and told them what the Godzilla has said.
They talk there for hours, and finally all of them are walking towards the Godzilla.
The smallest creature take a token out of their bag, and show it to the Godzilla.
"Hello mister Godzilla, I've learned that you've been suffering from the pain of hunger, I offer you my Ore Token, this should help you feeling better" They said.
The Godzilla take the token and eat it.
Magically, he feels a little bit better.
"What is this thing!? I have only ate one of them and I feel so much better! But it hasn't taken away my hunger yet" Said the Godzilla frowning.
The other 9 creatures step forward and offer the Godzilla their Ore Token, each person has 1 token. The Godzilla looked hopeful and thankful to them, he feels touch by their kindness.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <p class="small">The Godzilla eat the token one by one, for each token he ate, he feel better and better and after ate the 5th piece, he feels so full already.
            "Ahhh friends, I am so grateful for your help, now I am feeling so full. Is it okay if I keep the other 5 pieces? Just in case" Said the Godzilla.
            "You can keep them as you want! If you need more, we will be very happy to help you fins them!" Said one of the creature.
            They spent the day by talking and sharing their story, by the sunset all of the creatures preparing their return to their village.
            "I'll see you again my friends" Godzilla said. "You guys are the best! Ore token is my answer!" He continues. <span class="text-gore">Since then, Godzilla changed its name to Gorezilla.</span></p>
          <!-- <p>Our outdated predecessors directly impact the user experience and reduce revenue. ORE System simplifies this and uses the much faster and cheaper Binance Smart Chain. Leveraging current and bleeding edge technologies, ORE System ensures a complete end-to-end solution for Gamers, Creators, and Developers. This experience reduces the production time of blockchain based game development and increases the core user pool to integrate direct value to Gamers and Content Creators.
            ORE System has created the ORE Forge NFT Marketplace to provide Game Developers the ability to create their in-game NFT items with a few simple clicks. Each item can hold a real-world value and incentives Gamers to collect, trade, and own the game items. Gamers can use The ORE Forge for auctioning, selling, or buying their game collectibles continuing to build support for each Developer. Content Creators can leverage The ORE Forge to generate content available to Developers for licensing and purchase within future ORE supported games. This lifecycle provides a complete ecosystem for Next Generation Gaming and NFTs.
            ORE System integrates The ORE Token for Gamers, Content Creators, and Developers to seamlessly and interchangeably use throughout all of the ORE supported games. The ORE Token is also used by Gamers to buy, auction, and sell items on the ORE Forge. The ORE Token provides direct benefits to EVERY holder by distributing 3% of each transaction back to individual holders. Unlike other game currencies or points, ORE Token is worth real money, and should a Gamer ever decide they no longer want to use them, they can be sold back to the exchange. No longer is the Gamer’s money hostage to the game. This free market will not only bolster the increased value of the token, but will raise the value of each developer’s game items in turn.
            ORE SDK is the backbone of The ORE System. In one line of code a developer can integrate The ORE Token as an in-game currency without any knowledge of how the blockchain works. Game Developers don’t need to be Blockchain Developers, they can do what they love and make games. The ORE SDK directly integrates with The ORE Forge NFT items, and again allows Developers a single line of code to import their NFT items into their games. This efficiency allows Development Studios the ability to increase the speed of their blockchain development timelines, and reduces the overall cost to the organization. The ORE System maintains and manages the blockchain smart contracts, offloading the risk and maintenance, ensuring uptime and support.</p> -->
